              <p class="font-futura">Lucy is a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research sits at the intersection of anthropological archaeology and historical ecology, employing community-based participatory research
                practices as the foundation for empirically rigorous data collection and theoretical formulation. She co-directs Darién Profundo, a collaborative project based in eastern Panama, which employs community mapping, paleoecology, and
                ethnography, in addition to archaeological field and laboratory methods, to document the deep local history of Darién Province. These investigations have implications for ecological conservation and Indigenous sovereignty within the
                area, and her work develops strategies for collaboration with various stakeholder communities, at all phases of the research process. She is also collaborating with the Confederated Villages of Lisjan, on whose ancestral lands UC
                Berkeley sits, to develop noninvasive archaeological methods that can document and protect sacred ancestral sites. She has previously worked in Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and elsewhere in the United States. In the
                classroom, Lucy works with middle and high school teachers and other university educators to improve multicultural heritage literacy in the United States.
