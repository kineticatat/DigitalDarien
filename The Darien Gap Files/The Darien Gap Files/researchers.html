      Kristin is an Assistant Professor in the Creative Technologies Program at Illinois State University, exploring the role that computation plays in embodied creative processes. She has a history of working in choreography, computational creativity, media performance, interactive art and design tools due to her background in movement, technical theater, interaction design and programming. Kristin is a researcher with the movingstories: Tools for Digital Movement, Meaning and Interaction research partnership exploring the cognition of movement experience and designing movement applications for creativity support tools. She was the Executive Producer for the 21st International Symposium for Electronic Art  (ISEA2015) held in Vancouver, Canada and publishes in the fields of cognitive science, computational creativity, movement and computing and electronic art. She holds a BFA in Dance from the University of Illinois at Urbana, Champaign, an MSc and PhD from Simon Fraser University in Interactive Arts and Technology, studying with Dr. Thecla Schiphorst and Dr. Philippe Pasquier.

          Lucy is a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research sits at the intersection of anthropological archaeology and historical ecology, employing community-based participatory research practices as the foundation for empirically rigorous data collection and theoretical formulation. She co-directs Darién Profundo, a collaborative project based in eastern Panama, which employs community mapping, paleoecology, and ethnography,
  in addition to archaeological field and laboratory methods, to document the deep local history of Darién Province. These investigations have implications for ecological conservation and Indigenous sovereignty within the area, and her work develops strategies
  for collaboration with various stakeholder communities, at all phases of the research process. She is also collaborating with the Confederated Villages of Lisjan, on whose ancestral lands UC Berkeley sits, to develop noninvasive archaeological methods that
  can document and protect sacred ancestral sites. She has previously worked in Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and elsewhere in the United States. In the classroom, Lucy works with middle and high school teachers and other university educators to improve
  multicultural heritage literacy in the United States.
